see flag_chart.md for the full list. </p><p>version 5.7.1 </p><p>change-log: </p><table border="1"><thead><tr><th>ver</th><th>changes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>5.7.1:</td><td>improve handling of hypothetical non-sensible Reddit-Github fusion syntaxes.&nbsp; better form the Github-targeting Readme.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>|5.7:|fix error in Reddit-style table parser, and extend it to handle Github-style tables. |5.6:|repair Windows support.&nbsp; HTML output can now target new 910 forum.&nbsp; disable broken JSON debug-output target.| |5.5:|emoji, degdegs, native bbcode ols compatible with 910CMX, Reddit-style spoilers, | |5.4:|fixed mistake causing altogether wrong behaviour of nosetexthead flag.&nbsp; convert the readme and flag chart to be mdplay input themselves.&nbsp; make double-spaces in input pass through to the HTML output.&nbsp; fix bug splitting list items into two paragraphs between the second and third markdown line.| |5.3:|fix some glitches with escaping in output by means of new &quot;agglomerate&quot; function fusing adjacent text nodes in the mdplay tree.&nbsp; make IDs given to spoiler tags by renderers which have to assign their own such IDs more deterministic, so as to facilitate diffing html output before and after changes.&nbsp; re-organise flags system, ironing out some faults in the process.| |5.2:|fix issues with nested ol lists, including ul/ol combinations.&nbsp; ordered lists are, at length, altogether supported (subject to output limitations).| |5.1:|correct TVTropes heading syntax.&nbsp; further work on list processing, especially on the BBcode side, adding several flags.&nbsp; other tweaks.| |5.0:|work on lists, including rudimentary ordered list support at long length.&nbsp; allow (but make disablable) un-escaping of sloppy (no&nbsp; semicolon) html entities listed as accepted thusly in the Python html5 entity table.| |4:13|entity un-escape input during, not before, parsing so as to allow syntax features to be escaped using entities, as well as other tweaks.| |4:12|add TVTropes-style-syntax renderer.&nbsp; fix serious entity un-escaping bug of decoding ampersand entity at the wrong time (and not predictably either).&nbsp; add escaping to the MediaWiki-syntax renderer.| |4:11|fix to htmlalt and bbcode: terminate list even if last node in document or snippet.&nbsp; actually use Reddit-style table alignments in HTML output.| |4:10|stop always outputting debug output to mega.txt.&nbsp; process bare URLs as links (not needed by the BBCode/MediaWiki outputs but benefits the HTML output substantially).&nbsp; html5 entity un-escaping in markdown sources.&nbsp; stop nowikitext discarding ReST tables (derp).| |4.9:|don't utterly bork on markup within alt text.&nbsp; iron out some old quirks which i put into the parser, including enabling non-designated indented code blocks by default.&nbsp; add HTML5 entities from the current Python&nbsp; source tree.&nbsp; add support for MediaWiki-style wikilinks (not external links) in Markdown input (useful if used to write a wiki-page).&nbsp; fix htmlalt newline-stripping code blocks.| |4.8:|added nobackslashspace flag to markdown renderer, fixed flag support in markdown renderer.&nbsp; fixed problem with UTF-8 input causing renderers to fail with a UnicodeDecodeError (by splitting into Unicode characters, not bytes, in the inline parser).&nbsp; added strict mode.| |4.7:|markdown renderer, enabling distillation to an extent as well as round-trip testing.&nbsp; by that means, fix bug involving detection of opening fences without classes as ReST-style headings.&nbsp; furthermore add support for Reddit-style tables (in input) and code spans.&nbsp; also avoid extraneous whitespace in HTML where possible.| |4.6:|make the undocumented TVTropes link exposure feature in the writers an optional feature enablable through a flag.&nbsp; use valid HTML for nested lists in the non-DOM writer also.&nbsp; make existing renderers implement the flag system properly.&nbsp; allow escaping of close-brackets in link targets (including wikilinks).&nbsp; fix fusing of separate lists.&nbsp; STILL NO OL TAGS, and seems more trouble than worth anyway (MD list syntax seems disputed at best).| |4.5:|added experimental MediaWiki-dialect wikitext renderer.&nbsp; fixed handling of two-space line breaks in list items.&nbsp; use valid (rather than merely browser-condoned) HTML for nested lists (DOM-based renderer only).| |4.4:|better indented code parsing.&nbsp; flag system API for writers as well as the parser.&nbsp; add table handling to BBCode writer (was only present in HTML at first) - might work depending on targeted BBCode dialect.&nbsp; added snippet renderer API.&nbsp; fix detecting headings as tables.| |4.3:|added a subset of ReST simple table support, and add a flag system for enabling non-designated indented code blocks.&nbsp; ol still pending.| |4.2:|added polish.&nbsp; now functions as an importable Python package.&nbsp; added load_renderer mechanism.&nbsp; added HTML5 mode.&nbsp; proper entity escaping.| |4.1:|spanking new HTML export code using minidom.&nbsp; no added syntax&nbsp; features.&nbsp; command-line interface.| |4.0:|added HTML output support, sorted out handling of instances where braces do not contain a BibTeX diacritic.| |3.9:|much better BibTeX diacritic support.| |3.8:|added partial BibTeX umlaut support, including code derived from the Python Documentation LaTeX-to-ReST converter (under a &quot;BSD&quot; licence, almost certainly the same one as Sphinx itself, hence that is what I attached to the file so as to satisfy its terms).&nbsp; to my own licence for the rest of the program, added a non-misrepresentation clause.| |3.7:|ReST indented code block support, fixing a nasty residual bug in the process.| |3.6:|fix paras disappearing etc if followed by rules without empty line.| |3.5:|fix ReST heading over-lines being detected/parsed as MW headings.| |3.4:|fix a nested emphasis bug that has been in here since the get-go.&nbsp; also add MediaWiki emphases.| |3.3:|more accurate regexps, regexps in place of convoluted testing, fix&nbsp; problem of rules being swallowed (since 3.1), MediaWiki headings.| |3.2:|fix the global variables problem properly this time.| |3.1:|complete support for ReST headings, this has a slight risk of breaking&nbsp; compatibility with a given Markdown doc, but only slight.&nbsp; fix, in&nbsp; theory, as stopgap, the more-than-one-doc problem.| |3.0:|fix handling of underscore emphasis before (semi)colons, as in 2.1, and&nbsp; split from a script into many modules and implement partial support for&nbsp; ReST-style extended Setext headings.&nbsp; note that this will not behave&nbsp; correctly if used to translate more than one document.| |2.x:|[later 2.x revisions (2.1 through 2.4) back-ported fixes from 3.x]| |2.0:|code spans were not correctly implemented (they were merely implemented&nbsp; as monospace format spans) and i have no intent of improving upon this so i removed it.&nbsp; fixed middle-of-word underscore behaviour.| |1.4:|more conventional link escaping rules.| |1.3:|fix compatibility with Python (2.5 &lt; version &lt; 3.0), i.e.&nbsp; Python 2.6 and&nbsp; 2.7.| |1.2:|fixed some crashes.&nbsp; added subscript, and alternate syntaxes for bold,&nbsp; italic and superscript, and spoilers.| |1.1:|bug-fix: handle &quot;\&quot; correctly.| |1.0:|first &quot;release&quot;.| </p><p>this software is, unless otherwise specified: </p><p>Copyright (c) 2015, 2016 Thomas Hori.&nbsp; All rights reserved. </p><p>Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met: </p><ol><li value="1">Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer. </li><li value="2">Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution. </li><li value="3">Neither the name of the copyright holder nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission. </li><li value="4">Altered versions in any form must not be misrepresented as being the original software. </li></ol><p>THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS &quot;AS IS&quot;
