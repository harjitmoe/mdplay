see flag_chart.md for the full list. </p><p>version 5.5 </p><p>change-log: </p><table border="1"><thead><tr><th>ver </th><th>changes </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>5.5: </td><td>emoji, degdegs, native bbcode ols compatible with 910CMX, Reddit-style spoilers, </td></tr><tr><td>5.4: </td><td>fixed mistake causing altogether wrong behaviour of nosetexthead flag.&nbsp; convert the readme and flag chart to be mdplay input themselves.&nbsp; make double-spaces in input pass through to the HTML output.&nbsp; fix bug splitting list items into two paragraphs between the second and third markdown line. </td></tr><tr><td>5.3: </td><td>fix some glitches with escaping in output by means of new &quot;agglomerate&quot; function fusing adjacent text nodes in the mdplay tree.&nbsp; make IDs given to spoiler tags by renderers which have to assign their own such IDs more deterministic, so as to facilitate diffing html output before and after changes.&nbsp; re-organise flags system, ironing out some faults in the process. </td></tr><tr><td>5.2: </td><td>fix issues with nested ol lists, including ul/ol combinations.&nbsp; ordered lists are, at length, altogether supported (subject to output limitations). </td></tr><tr><td>5.1: </td><td>correct TVTropes heading syntax.&nbsp; further work on list processing, especially on the BBcode side, adding several flags.&nbsp; other tweaks. </td></tr><tr><td>5.0: </td><td>work on lists, including rudimentary ordered list support at long length.&nbsp; allow (but make disablable) un-escaping of sloppy (no semicolon) html entities listed as accepted thusly in the Python html5 entity table. </td></tr><tr><td>4:13 </td><td>entity un-escape input during, not before, parsing so as to allow syntax features to be escaped using entities, as well as other tweaks. </td></tr><tr><td>4:12 </td><td>add TVTropes-style-syntax renderer.&nbsp; fix serious entity un-escaping bug of decoding ampersand entity at the wrong time (and not predictably either).&nbsp; add escaping to the MediaWiki-syntax renderer. </td></tr><tr><td>4:11 </td><td>fix to htmlalt and bbcode: terminate list even if last node in document or snippet.&nbsp; actually use Reddit-style table alignments in HTML output. </td></tr><tr><td>4:10 </td><td>stop always outputting debug output to mega.txt.&nbsp; process bare URLs as links (not needed by the BBCode/MediaWiki outputs but benefits the HTML output substantially).&nbsp; html5 entity un-escaping in markdown sources.&nbsp; stop nowikitext discarding ReST tables (derp). </td></tr><tr><td>4.9: </td><td>don't utterly bork on markup within alt text.&nbsp; iron out some old quirks which i put into the parser, including enabling non-designated indented code blocks by default.&nbsp; add HTML5 entities from the current Python source tree.&nbsp; add support for MediaWiki-style wikilinks (not external links) in Markdown input (useful if used to write a wiki-page).&nbsp; fix htmlalt newline-stripping code blocks. </td></tr><tr><td>4.8: </td><td>added nobackslashspace flag to markdown renderer, fixed flag support in markdown renderer.&nbsp; fixed problem with UTF-8 input causing renderers to fail with a UnicodeDecodeError (by splitting into Unicode characters, not bytes, in the inline parser).&nbsp; added strict mode. </td></tr><tr><td>4.7: </td><td>markdown renderer, enabling distillation to an extent as well as round-trip testing.&nbsp; by that means, fix bug involving detection of opening fences without classes as ReST-style headings.&nbsp; furthermore add support for Reddit-style tables (in input) and code spans.&nbsp; also avoid extraneous whitespace in HTML where possible. </td></tr><tr><td>4.6: </td><td>make the undocumented TVTropes link exposure feature in the writers an optional feature enablable through a flag.&nbsp; use valid HTML for nested lists in the non-DOM writer also.&nbsp; make existing renderers implement the flag system properly.&nbsp; allow escaping of close-brackets in link targets (including wikilinks).&nbsp; fix fusing of separate lists.&nbsp; STILL NO &lt;OL&gt;S, and seems more trouble than worth anyway (MD list syntax seems disputed at best). </td></tr><tr><td>4.5: </td><td>added experimental MediaWiki-dialect wikitext renderer.&nbsp; fixed handling of two-space line breaks in list items.&nbsp; use valid (rather than merely browser-condoned) HTML for nested lists (DOM-based renderer only). </td></tr><tr><td>4.4: </td><td>better indented code parsing.&nbsp; flag system API for writers as well as the parser.&nbsp; add table handling to BBCode writer (was only present in HTML at first) - might work depending on targeted BBCode dialect.&nbsp; added snippet renderer API.&nbsp; fix detecting headings as tables. </td></tr><tr><td>4.3: </td><td>added a subset of ReST simple table support, and add a flag system for enabling non-designated indented code blocks.&nbsp; &lt;ol&gt; still pending. </td></tr><tr><td>4.2: </td><td>added polish.&nbsp; now functions as an importable Python package. added load_renderer mechanism.&nbsp; added HTML5 mode.&nbsp; proper entity escaping. </td></tr><tr><td>4.1: </td><td>spanking new HTML export code using minidom.&nbsp; no added syntax features.&nbsp; command-line interface. </td></tr><tr><td>4.0: </td><td>added HTML output support, sorted out handling of instances where braces do not contain a BibTeX diacritic. </td></tr><tr><td>3.9: </td><td>much better BibTeX diacritic support. </td></tr><tr><td>3.8: </td><td>added partial BibTeX umlaut support, including code derived from the Python Documentation LaTeX-to-ReST converter (under a &quot;BSD&quot; licence, almost certainly the same one as Sphinx itself, hence that is what I attached to the file so as to satisfy its terms).&nbsp; to my own licence for the rest of the program, added a non-misrepresentation clause. </td></tr><tr><td>3.7: </td><td>ReST indented code block support, fixing a nasty residual bug in the process. </td></tr><tr><td>3.6: </td><td>fix paras disappearing etc if followed by rules without empty line. </td></tr><tr><td>3.5: </td><td>fix ReST heading over-lines being detected/parsed as MW headings. </td></tr><tr><td>3.4: </td><td>fix a nested emphasis bug that has been in here since the get-go. also add MediaWiki emphases. </td></tr><tr><td>3.3: </td><td>more accurate regexps, regexps in place of convoluted testing, fix problem of rules being swallowed (since 3.1), MediaWiki headings. </td></tr><tr><td>3.2: </td><td>fix the global variables problem properly this time. </td></tr><tr><td>3.1: </td><td>complete support for ReST headings, this has a slight risk of breaking compatibility with a given Markdown doc, but only slight.&nbsp; fix, in theory, as stopgap, the more-than-one-doc problem. </td></tr><tr><td>3.0: </td><td>fix handling of underscore emphasis before (semi)colons, as in 2.1, and split from a script into many modules and implement partial support for ReST-style extended Setext headings.&nbsp; note that this will not behave correctly if used to translate more than one document. </td></tr><tr><td>2.x: </td><td>[later 2.x revisions (2.1 through 2.4) back-ported fixes from 3.x] </td></tr><tr><td>2.0: </td><td>code spans were not correctly implemented (they were merely implemented as monospace format spans) and i have no intent of improving upon this so i removed it.&nbsp; fixed middle-of-word underscore behaviour. </td></tr><tr><td>1.4: </td><td>more conventional link escaping rules. </td></tr><tr><td>1.3: </td><td>fix compatibility with Python (2.5 &lt; version &lt; 3.0), i.e. Python 2.6 and 2.7. </td></tr><tr><td>1.2: </td><td>fixed some crashes.&nbsp; added subscript, and alternate syntaxes for bold, italic and superscript, and spoilers. </td></tr><tr><td>1.1: </td><td>bug-fix: handle &quot;\&quot; correctly. </td></tr><tr><td>1.0: </td><td>first &quot;release&quot;. </td></tr></tbody></table><p>this software is, unless otherwise specified: </p><p>Copyright (c) 2015, 2016 Thomas Hori.&nbsp;
